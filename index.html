          One of the activities that I really enjoy is teaching. This interest of mine was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's dedication to teaching. I have been involved in many activities of teaching, ranging from being a teaching assistant for my professor to imparting lectures on deep learning for the IEEE group in my college, as well as being a facilitator to teach and manage over 300 students.
